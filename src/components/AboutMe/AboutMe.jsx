          <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
          I am a Malvern-based full-stack software engineer currently working for the Vanguard Group. <br />
          After completing my bachelor's degree at New York University, <br />
          I recalled my first ever experience of web management as a child back in 2002.<br />
          About two decades later, I have become lucky to find my passion in web development again.<br />
          I dream of becoming a creative developer who enjoys challenging with passion.<br />
