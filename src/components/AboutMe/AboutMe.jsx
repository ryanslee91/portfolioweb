          <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
          I am a full-stack software engineer currently based in Brooklyn, New York. <br />
          My first ever experience of web development happened in 2002 while managing an internet blog as a child.<br />
          About two decades later, I have become lucky to find my passion in web development again.<br />
          Having a goal to raise my web development skills to professional level, <br />
          I have decided to study and gain essential skills and knowledge. <br />
          I dream of becoming a creative web developer who enjoys challenging with passion.<br />
